            <p class="col-lg-6"> Hey there, I'm Leslie the owner of Happy Hannah Art! My business is individually owned and operated out of Northern California, so I pretty much try to do it all (for now)! 
                I'm an artist and sticker enthusiast who loves to draw silly animals and fun snacks! As a '90s kid, I admired all of the brands that celebrated stickers and bright stationery that still inspire me today.
                <br><br>Happy Hannah Art's mission is to spread fun and positivity through stationery products. What better way to make someone smile 
                 than to surprise them with a sticker or greeting card? 
                 My business is named after my dog Hannah who is the star of my previous sticker club that included a Hannah-narrated newsletter and newly-designed stickers that were sent to family and friends.
               I hope my art helps send a bit more sunshine your way!
