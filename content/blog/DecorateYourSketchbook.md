A long, long time ago my friend in high school shared a magical way to decorate sketchbook and journal covers. She took a usually dull sketchbook cover and transformed it into collages of vibrant anime art, J-Pop icons, and printouts of anything else she was into at the time. I immediately adapted this collage technique and curated my own set of thumbnail-sized images. In high school I used to fill volumes of those half-sheet hardbound sketchbooks with an ongoing comic series. I decorated my sketchbooks with whatever manga or art I was into at the time which made me happy to dive right in and draw again.

**So let's add some more joy to your drawing or writing excercises by collaging your own books! The procedure to decorate a sketchbook cover is simple:**

### 1. Gather small clippings or printouts of imagery that you love

### 2. Glue them on your sketchbook or journal cover

### 3. Laminate the cover with multiple strips of packaging tape for a good protective seal

That's pretty much it! Now, is it easier to just impose a collage in InDesign and then print it out on one huge piece of sticker paper? Sure, but where's the fun in that?! I rarely do much hands-on crafting, but taking the time to cover these books in imagery I love allows me to appreciate them even more. Piecing and balancing the collage together also feels like a fun puzzle. Throughout the year I like to save funny images or beautiful artwork I come across online. When it's time to collect imagery for a new sketchbook cover, I impose them into thumbnail-sized images, print, and then cut them out to begin the collage process. 

If you keep a sketchbook or journal, I hope this helps encourage you to take some time to do some crafting and in turn surround yourself with fun and inspirational imagery every time you draw or write! 

I would love to see what sketchbook covers you collage! Maybe you've already done this in the past or have a different technique? Feel free to tag me [@HappyHannahArtShop](https://www.instagram.com/happyhannahartshop/) on Instagram if you want to share!
