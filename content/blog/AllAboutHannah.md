Hey friends, it's Leslie, the gal who runs Happy Hannah Art! You may be wondering, who is Hannah? Besides being a dog with a spicy persona, Hannah was the inspiration behind my business name, Happy Hannah Art. 

It all started when I began a free sticker club for my nieces and nephews called Happy Hannah Sticker Club back in August 2022. The club revolves around Hannah "writing" a newsletter and sending three new sticker sheet designs every month that I designed, printed, and cut from home. I figured this way, everyone wins: I get a good kick in the pants to make sure I create new designs every month, while kids get to enjoy something fun in the mail!

The club has since grown to include more friends and family. If you were interested in becoming part of the club, please stay tuned! I'm thinking of expanding the club to allow new members to join from a subscription service if you were would like to support my art that way! 

Now that's out of the way, on to Hannah! Here are some fun facts:

- Breed: Siberian Husky and German Shepherd
- Birthdate: November 14, 2015 (a true Scorpio!)
- Favorite Snacks: Charlee Bears
- Favorite Toy: A stinky old squeaky koala that was only $3 from HomeGoods, but for some reason has stood the test of time and still squeaks to this day. Also, a crusty squeaky hedgehog.
- Favorite Treat: Plain white rice- when the pressure cooker goes off, she knows she's in for a tasty treat soon!
- Hobbies: Yelling at people, yelling in general, going to the pet "resort" and hanging out with friends, spotting flies, and building her investment portfolio
- Favorite Color: Red
- Least Favorite Things: Long car rides and things that move on their own (so maybe ghosts?)
