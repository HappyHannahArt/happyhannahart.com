I recently finished a sketchbook I started a couple of years ago. Wow, it sure has been a while since I did that, especially since moving to more digital drawing nowadays! The updates in this book were sporadic with some long gaps in between. Do you ever start a sketchbook and then jump to a random other project or some other shiny new sketchbook? Back in 2022 I was trying to pick up the habit of drawing once a day, but unfortunately ended up fading out of it. I think the key here is not to be so hard on yourself to strictly keep a daily habit schedule or at least give yourself some slack if you miss a day or two. Overall do whatever works best for you, there's no pressure to keep the perfect sketchbook! Once I eased up on my own personal unrealistic expectations, was when I enjoyed regularly updating my sketchbook as more like an illustrated journal.

A little backstory on this particular sketchbook: I used a 5.5 x 8 inch hardbound sketchbook that's durable and easy to travel. In high school, I always filled these books with comics and notes from my art class. To make drawing even more fun, I decorated the plain black cover with printed pictures of whatever I was into at the time and then "laminated" it with packaging tape. My creative friend from high school introduced me to this method and I've loved using it ever since! My advice is to find whatever type of sketchbook you resonate with most: some love the moleskins because they're small and convenient to carry, while some love the huge spiral bounds. The point is to make drawing as enjoyable and easily accessible as possible.

So let's get into my 5 reasons to keep a sketchbook:

### 1. Keep track of ideas
This can range from scribbled notes to illustrated points. There's something said about using different motor skills to write something on paper vs. just typing a note on your phone. While both are great ways to track notes, I find writing/drawing on paper gives more freedom to play around on a blank page and offers something to revisit later, which segues into the next related reason:

### 2. Inspiration for future artwork
I've drawn some doodles in my sketchbook months ago that later inspired ideas for new artwork once I revisited them. You never know when inspiration can strike, so I highly recommend going through old sketchbooks!

### 3. Document events
My sketchbook drawing took a serious turn when I decided to stop overthinking subject matter and began doodling cartoons of whatever I was going through at the time. This was also a handy way to document that moment I usually would have forgotten about had I not drawn it. If you want to try documenting your own events, anything is welcome in your sketchbook from writing full pages, poetry, doodles, comics, notes, still-life drawings, or whatever works best for you!

### 4. Relieve stress
Drawing in your sketchbook can help declutter your mind when you focus on the act of physically drawing or writing. I personally love drawing in my sketchbook first thing in the morning with coffee and some sort of travel YouTube video on in the background. It's my uninterrupted quiet time of the day that I love making into a routine. That said, I don't do it EVERY morning, so don't stress yourself out by forcing yourself to draw everyday. When you take time to draw or write, you put focus on that action rather than the ranting thoughts that may have been plaguing you before. Think of your sketchbook as a meditative mindfulness activity.

### 5. Practice drawing
And lastly, drawing in a sketchbook allows you to practice drawing! You can use it as an opportunity to challenge yourself on new techniques or to explore your style. If you don't know what to draw, look around and draw what's in the room. Or maybe try a theme to narrow down subject matter choices such as a month where you draw cats on a unicycle. Illustrate your favorite recipe or doodle a favorite memory. Play around with different media or colors to experiment what works best for you. There are no rules but to have fun!

Enjoy the process of exploring your creativity with a sketchbook! I would love to see what sketchbooks you enjoy using, feel free to tag me [@HappyHannahArtShop](https://www.instagram.com/happyhannahartshop/) on Instagram if you want to share!
